# simple-rpg
Created for Project 3 of the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.  A simple role-playing "game" made with React. Features turn-based combat. 

Author: Elbin Cenisev

## Description
This is a proof-of-concept for a role-playing game made in React. It's barely a game, but it was fun trying to create at least some interactivity using React, though it is essentially just a menu with pictures. There are lots of things I would like to try and implement in the future, but this was all I could muster in two weeks.

## User Experience
This is a unfinished computer game that can be played through the browser. Users need to first create an account that they can save their created characters to. Then, they can create a character to play the game with. This is a simple turn-based role-playing game that features very lite use of dungeons & dragons-style ability scores.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap CSS Framework, React, GraphQL, Mongoose, ApolloServer, Redux, Semantic UI React

## Installation
