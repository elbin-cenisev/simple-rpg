Author: Elbin Cenisev

## General Notes
This is a proof-of-concept for a role-playing game made in React. It's barely a game, but it was fun trying to create at least some interactivity using React, though it is essentially just a menu with pictures. There are lots of things I would like to try and implement in the future, but this was all I could muster in two weeks.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap CSS Framework, React, GraphQL, Mongoose, ApolloServer, Redux, Semantic UI React
